Prokka is not designed for Viruses whatsoever.

hCoV is a complicated genome with a polyprotein and many mat_peptides, some of which arise during ribosomal slippage etc so can't be trivially annotated anyway.

If you submit your genome to NCBI (like we did) they will annotate it for you. They have a rapid submission process for hCoV.
